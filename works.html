        <p>Here you can find a list of things that I've made (and am somewhat proud of), either in my spare time, or as a part of my education.<p>

            <a href="https://nightanimal333.itch.io/game-jam-simulator">Game Jam Simulator</a> 
            <p>Game Jam Simulator is a small game, where the player takes control of a game developer during a game jam. The game was developed, unsurprisingly, during a 48-hour game jam. The player must finish their work by managing their Game Progress, Coffee and Madness levels through various minigames and events.</p>
            <p>I have also created most of the graphical assets for this game.</p>

            <p>Teleportation Game is a small and very crude technical demo, created in Unity, developed during a 48-hour game jam. It plays around with the idea of the player using a gun to teleport around a level, made out of free-floating platforms, and a melee weapon to kill enemies.</p>

            <p>QuaggaMusic is a rest API, developed in Go. It uses multiple different APIs and provides information about various musical artists, events and songs. It also features a random playlist generator, based on user input. The API keys are out of date, so some of the functionality no longer works, but tfeel free to check out the source.</p>
